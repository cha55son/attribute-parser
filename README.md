Pet project to solve the following HackerRank challenge in C++.
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/attribute-parser/problem

Disclaimer: This is in no way a production grade codebase. 

I wanted to dive back into C++ again and figured this would be a good start. 
This project relies heavily on unit tests as I find it's a great way to learn 
any language and it's runtime. It also covers some use-cases
that aren't explicitly mentioned in the problem. Mainly, because I either thought it would be 
an interesting challenge or I see potential for using it in the future.

### Testing

* Open the app in Visual Studio, open the `Test Explorer` pane and execute all tests.

### Troubleshooting

* Ensure Visual Studio is configured for C++17 to support the optional type.
